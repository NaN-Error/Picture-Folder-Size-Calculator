# Picture-Folder-Size-Calculator
A Python script that calculates the total size of picture files in a selected folder, excluding directories starting with '-'. Users select a folder via a Tkinter dialog, and the script sums the sizes of image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, .tiff) within it, displaying the total size in gigabytes.
